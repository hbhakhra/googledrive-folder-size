# Google Drive Folder Size
This is a chrome extension that computes the folder size by adding up the sizes of the individual files. The extension does not recursively compute the size, so only for the files in the folder directly. 

This extension currently works by screen scraping so the current implementation is probably going to need to be updated as the markup changes.
